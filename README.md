## Citibike Cruisin'
This analysis uses New York City bikesahring data for the month of August to create a business proposition for a bike sharing in Des Moines. The data is downloaded from the CitiBike website and cleaned in pandas. Then the data is vizualized using tableau to size up the market, understand peak rider times and areas, repair & maintenance costs as well as demographic questions such as if age or gender make a difference in rider participation.

## To Wrap It Up
Based on the areas of ridership in the central business district of Manhattan as well as a sizeable market of ridership occuring during peak commuting hours, it can be concluded that there is a sizeable opporutinity for ridership for local Mon-Fri workers. The other peak times include Saturday and Sunday where tourism and weekend plans increase overall bike sharing. Most bikes are not exceeding 250 trips a month so maintenance and upkeep would be marginal in comparison to average biek rental rates.
